# CMS Trigger SOC Benchmarking 
This repo contains instructions for running the benchmarks: Coremark, Drhystone 2.1, and Whetstone on SOCs.  By all running these benchmarks with the same configuration we are able to make meaningful comparisons between devices.  A full discussion of these benchmarks and what their results mean is available in the [initial report](zynq_build/Zynq%20Benchmarking.pdf).  

To see all results to date, [view this table](SubmittingResults.md).

To contribute your own results follow these instructions:

1. [Running Benchmarks](./RunningBenchmarks.md)
2. [Contributing results](./SubmittingResults.md)

Optionally, these instructions on [building Petalinux for a Zynq ](./zynq_build/BuildingPetaLinux.md) may serve to help you get started or replicate our initial environment.
